# 🎉 Post-Deployment Next Steps

Your app is deployed! Here's what to do next:

## 1. Get Your App URL (1 minute)

In Railway dashboard:
- Go to your project
- Click on your service
- Find the **"Domains"** section
- Copy your public URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)

Or click **"Settings"** → **"Generate Domain"** if you don't have one yet.

## 2. Set Environment Variables (2 minutes) ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**Go to:** Railway Dashboard → Your Project → **"Variables"** tab

**Add these required variables:**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
```

**Optional (but recommended):**
```
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
```

**⚠️ Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the app will work but AI features won't function!**

## 3. Test Your Deployment (3 minutes)

### Test 1: Health Check
Open in browser:
```
https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health
```
Should show: `{"status": "ok"}`

### Test 2: Frontend
Open in browser:
```
https://your-app.up.railway.app
```
Should show the revision helper UI

### Test 3: Full Workflow
1. Create a revision (fill out the form)
2. Try uploading an image (optional)
3. Answer questions
4. View summary

## 4. Monitor Your App

**View Logs:**
- Railway Dashboard → Your Project → **"Deployments"** tab
- Click on a deployment → **"View Logs"**
- Or use Railway CLI: `railway logs`

**Check Status:**
- Green = Running
- Yellow = Building
- Red = Error (check logs)

## 5. Share Your App

Your app is now publicly accessible! Share the URL with:
- Your kids
- Their friends
- Anyone who wants to use it
