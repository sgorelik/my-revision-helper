# Calculator Logo

Please add the calculator character image as `calculator-logo.png` in this directory (`frontend/public/`).

The image should be:
- A 3D-rendered cartoon calculator character with a graduation cap
- Orange body with light blue-green screen/face
- PNG format recommended
- Recommended size: 192x192px or larger (will be scaled to 48x48px in the UI)

The logo will be automatically displayed in the header of the application. If the image is not found, the logo will be hidden gracefully.
